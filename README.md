Course project for CIS650


This is the source code for CIS650 final project: course prediction.

Please check the live site of this web app: http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu:3838/course-prediction/

How to use:

Select all of your taken CIS&MTH course grades. Select the course that you want to predict as "?". 
Click "Predic Your Selected Course", then you will be able to see the prediction made by the system. 

Important note: Since we don't have enough training data, the result of the prediction might not make any senses at all.
We will work on the data collecting part further. However, you can help us at this point by submitting your course-grade
data by clicking "Add Your Grade to Our System" after you selecting taken courses properly. 


Feel free to use all the source code if you are interested in.
